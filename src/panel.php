 *   host   an Architrave that hands the panel over. The theme says what it
 *          offers with a number, ARCHITRAVE_PANEL_HOST: 2 = the focus mode is
 *          the theme's own file (focus-mode.js, which presets.js hands over to)
 *          and the theme loads no panel script itself; 3 = the shipped
 *          style.css is the theme's half only.
 *   old    an Architrave from before the split. It still carries its own whole
 *          panel, so the plugin stands back and says nothing.
 *   guest  any other theme. Until 0.8.0 this fell in with `old` and the plugin
 *          did nothing at all: measured on stock Twenty Twenty-Five, not one
 *          file was served and nothing appeared on the page. Now the plugin
 *          brings what the theme used to lend it - the scripts the panel needs,
 *          its stylesheet, the values it draws itself with, and a button to
 *          open it, because there is no rail for one to sit in.
 *
 * Asked late: the theme is not loaded when plugins are.
 * `architrave_asset_version()` is the tell for an Architrave of any age; it has
 * been in the theme since long before the panel, so an old one is never

 * THE THEME'S OWN COLOURS FOLLOW A LOOK (2026-09-23, Twenty Twenty-Four under
 * Book: the page turned tan and every band the theme had coloured itself kept
 * its white or its black, so the page came out striped).
 *
 * A block theme does not paint a band with a colour; it paints it with a NAME
 * from its palette ("Base 2", "Contrast"), and core writes that name as
 * `var(--wp--preset--color--<slug>)`. So while a look is on, the names are
 * pointed at the look instead. Every theme names its colours differently, so
 * nothing here goes by the name: each colour is placed by where it stands
 * between the theme's own page and its own text, and takes the same place
 * between the look's page and the look's text. The page's own colour becomes
 * the look's page, the text's becomes the look's ink, a grey halfway between
 * becomes the halfway mix, and a colour paler than the page itself becomes the
 * look's paper. A dark band keeps being the dark band, in the look's colours.
 *
 * A COLOUR WITH A HUE TAKES THE LOOK'S ACCENT (Manuel, 2026-09-23, choosing B
 * on a side-by-side of Ollie under Book: its purple categories kept, or turned
 * into Book's brown). It was left alone at first, on the grounds that a look
 * has no partner for a theme's orange; but a look does have one highlight
 * colour, and a reader who picks Book wants Book. A strong hue becomes the
 * accent where it stood: a pale one a tint of it on the look's page, a middle
 * one the accent itself, a deep one the accent darkened with the look's ink.
 * A hue too faint to be a brand (a violet grey) is placed like a grey.
 * Original still shows every colour exactly as the theme has it.
 *
 * Gated on `data-chosen`, which is a look and never Original, so the theme's
 * own page is untouched. Filterable, and empty when there is nothing to move.

 * grey out under Original, since a theme without a dark side had none to give.
 * Now the panel makes one from the theme's own palette, placed the way a look
 * places it: every colour by where it stands between the theme's page and its
 * text.
 *
 * - The page takes the far end: a light theme's white becomes a near-black
 *   night paper, a dark theme's black a near-white one. The text takes the
 *   other end, and a grey halfway between stays halfway, so a band the theme
 *   drew a little darker than its page is drawn a little lighter than it.
 *   A grey that stood beyond the page (a white card on a pale grey page) stays
 *   one step off it, now on the other side.
 * - A colour with a hue keeps its hue. A pale tint becomes a deep one and a deep
 *   shade a pale one; a middle colour, the brand, is lifted just far enough to
 *   read on the night paper (or sunk to read on the day paper). That is how the
 *   system colours of Apple's dark mode differ from their light ones.
 * - Each colour keeps a little of its own tint, so a warm grey stays warm.
 *
 * Only while the theme's own look is on and the reader's side is not the
 * theme's: `data-theme` names the side, and neither a look (`data-chosen`) nor
 * the reader's own colours (`data-colours`) may be on. Everything is written as
 * the palette's own custom properties, so every block the theme painted with a
 * palette name follows, and nothing the theme did not name is touched.

/**
 * WHAT EACH ROLE'S SIZE DIAL MEASURES ITSELF AGAINST (0.9.0).
 *
 * A size is a multiplier and CSS cannot ask an element how big it already is,
 * so assets/js/guest-size.js reads it and writes back the product. This is the
 * one list of what it reads: the same areas the role table names in
 * assets/css/panel-page.css, narrowed to the elements that CARRY a size rather
 * than inherit one, since an element that inherits is already handled by the
 * stylesheet and would be measured through its parent here.
 *
 * Every role whose size starts out greyed is in here; the script takes a role
 * off that list once it has found something on the page to measure, so a size
 * row is live exactly where it can do something.
 *
 * `rest` is the size Architrave gives that part at rest (presets.js ROLE_DEFAULT:
 * the quote and the category line 26, small text 16, comments 14), which a LOOK
 * starts from on a guest since 2026-09-22; the parts with a `step` take their
 * rung from the generated --panel-rung-* instead. Interface has neither: a
 * horizontal navigation at Architrave's 13px rail size would be a mistake, so
 * it stays a ratio of the host's own.
 *
 * `step` names the rung this part of the article climbs when the reader presses
 * the A/A stepper. Measured on Architrave: two presses of Larger take the title
 * from 64 to 72, an h2 from 36 to 47 and a paragraph from 22 to 28, so each part
 * has a ladder of its own and a guest that moved the paragraphs alone was doing
 * a different thing (Manuel, 2026-09-22: "that Double A works differently than
 * Elmastudio"). The ratios are generated into panel-page.css as
 * `--panel-step-<step>`; an empty step is a part the stepper does not move.
