/**
 * Plugin Name:       Live Design Panel
 * Description:       Design your site on the live page: a panel with dials for colours, fonts, sizes and spacing, light and dark, and saved styles your readers can pick too.
 * Version:           0.18.0
 * Requires at least: 6.6
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * Author:            Elmastudio
 * Author URI:        https://elmastudio.de
 * License:           GPL-2.0-or-later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain:       live-design-panel
 *
 * The panel began inside the Architrave theme (2026-09-21) and this folder is
 * still ASSEMBLED by that theme's `tools/build-plugin.py`, so there is one
 * copy of every file and nothing can drift. On any block theme the plugin
 * stands alone: it brings the panel, its stylesheets, its fonts and its own
 * button, and the page keeps the theme's design until a dial moves. On an
 * Architrave that offers to host it (ARCHITRAVE_PANEL_HOST), the theme hands
 * the panel its rail and its square instead.
 *
 * @package LiveDesignPanel

/**
 * IT WAS CALLED ARCHITRAVE PANEL FOR ITS FIRST DAY (2026-09-21), in a folder of
 * that name. The two are the same code under the same function names, and
 * WordPress loads `architrave-panel` first: where it is still active this file
 * stops here and says what to do. THAT IS WHY THIS FILE HOLDS NO FUNCTION:
 * PHP declares a file's functions when it compiles the file, before a `return`
 * can run, so a guard above them guards nothing (the first try took a test
 * site down with "cannot redeclare"). Everything is in panel.php, which is
 * only read once the way is clear. Its code names
 * (architrave_panel_…, ARCHITRAVE_PANEL_…) and everything readers' saved looks
 * hang on (storage keys, the REST namespace, the script handles) keep the old
 * word on purpose.
