"""Split style.css into the theme's sheet and the panel plugin's sheet.

ONE SOURCE, TWO SHEETS (2026-09-21, the panel's move to a plugin). The rules
that draw the design panel and the rules that draw every style but Standard
are the plugin's. They are about 350 rules scattered through style.css, beside
the base rules they adjust and under the comments that explain both. Cutting
them into a second file by hand would tear every one of those passages in two
and freeze the stylesheet for a day while another session works in it daily.

So style.css STAYS WHOLE in the repository, and the two zips are cut from it
by rule: `build-dist.py` ships what is the theme's, `build-plugin.py` ships the
rest as `assets/css/panel.css`, which the plugin loads after the theme's sheet.
A rule is never edited, only sent one way or the other; a selector list with
both kinds is written twice, each half with its own selectors.

WHAT IS THE PLUGIN'S
  1. The panel's interface: a selector that names a `.reading-*` class the
     tiny panel (assets/js/tiny-panel.js) does not use.
  2. A style that is not Standard at rest: a selector whose root (`:root` or
     `html`) asks for a dial value Standard does not rest on, or for a colour
     room other than neutral. `REST` (read from plugin/settings.json)
     is the list `architrave_standard_at_rest()` prints in functions.php,
     whose tables tools/settings-list.mjs writes from presets.js itself
     (1.3.491); its --check fails when either is behind the script.

    python3 tools/split_style.py            report the two halves
    python3 tools/split_style.py --moved    print the plugin's half

THE ORDER CHANGES FOR WHAT MOVES: the plugin's sheet comes after the theme's,
so a moved rule now beats a theme rule of equal weight that used to follow it.
`KEEP` and `MOVE` below settle such a pair by hand; the judge that finds them
is tools/judge-panel-split.mjs on the BUILT zips.

# ── the guard a guest's panel stands behind ─────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY (0.11.47, Manuel on Ollie, 2026-09-24: white boxes behind the sliders and
# a white search field on the dark panel, "doesn't look like it belongs to the
# panel"). A theme styles its own `input` and `button`, and its rules match the
# panel's too. Where the panel names a property itself it wins, but wherever it
# leaves one to the browser's default a theme's rule has nothing to beat and
# lands: Ollie gave every slider a white ground, a border, padding and a shadow
# (`input:not([type="submit"]):not([type="radio"])`, one class-weight more than
# `.reading-range`); Kadence and Astra gave every panel button their padding,
# shadow and transition. Measured by switching every sheet but the panel's off
# and on and diffing each panel element's computed style: Ollie 115 values,
# Kadence 1021, Astra 1062, the two Twenty themes none.
#
# The guard is two things, and a guest gets both:
# 1. Every rule that draws the panel reaches a guest one ID stronger (GUARD is
#    added to its first compound), so it outranks any theme rule without an ID.
#    Lifting ALL of them keeps their order among themselves exactly as it is.
# 2. Under them, the panel's own buttons and fields go back to the browser's
#    defaults (`all: revert`), at the ID's weight but no class, so any rule of
#    the panel's still wins and no rule of the theme's does. The browser's
