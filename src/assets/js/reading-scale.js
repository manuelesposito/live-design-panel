/**
 * Architrave — the reading scale.
 *
 * Three steps, picked by the reader from the More menu, held in localStorage
 * and written to <html> as `data-reading`. The stylesheets do the rest:
 * quire.reading.css carries the SIZES (DS-257) and style.css carries this
 * site's own anatomy at each step — the row, the action square, the corner.
 *
 * THE STEPS COME FROM THE SYSTEM'S REGISTRY, never from a list typed here.
 * This file carried its own three for exactly one afternoon, which was the
 * honest arrangement while the design system did not name them — and it is the
 * arrangement DS-219 exists to end. The same lesson the mode picker learned
 * the expensive way: a retyped list goes stale in silence, and the day a
 * fourth step is registered nothing renders wrong, the step just is not there.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE COLOUR MODE'S, on purpose. Same storage-then-attribute
 * model, same menu grammar, same `.is-selected` plus check to say which is on,
 * same delegated click. A reader who has used one control has used the other.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT USE QuireReading.apply(). The registry's `default` is the
 * step that needs no attribute, which is Comfortable, because Comfortable is
 * what the system's `:root` says. THIS SITE'S default is a different step, so
 * apply()'s helpfulness — clearing the attribute for the registry default —
 * would be exactly wrong here: it would leave the reading sizes on Comfortable
 * while style.css's `:root` anatomy stayed on Default, a 20px body beside a
 * 36px row. The attribute is therefore always written, and the server writes
 * the same one on arrival (architrave_reading_attribute in functions.php).
 * resolve() and the step list are still the registry's, which is the part that
 * actually matters.
