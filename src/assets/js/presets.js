/**
 * Architrave — the styles.
 *
 * Four named looks a reader can put on: Standard, Book, Clear and Terminal
 * (Arcade waits backstage). Until 2026-09-09 they were "presets": a press that set the four
 * dials (colours, reading size, face, line spacing) and remembered nothing of
 * its own, so the moment a dial moved the preset was simply gone, and the
 * looks that made a style a style, grain, a drop cap, a justified column,
 * hung on the COLOUR room instead. Manuel, in Book, switching the colour to
 * Matrix: "that would probably be a customisation of the Book style, and Book
 * would lose its check mark". That is the Apple Books shape, and it is the
 * shape now:
 *
 * A STYLE IS A STATE OF ITS OWN. It is written on <html> as `data-style`
 * before first paint and held in localStorage like the dials, and the
 * stylesheet hangs the style's looks on that attribute: `data-style="book"`
 * is what draws the grain and the drop cap, whichever colours are under it.
 * Standard is the absence of the attribute, as Newsreader is the absence of
 * a face.
 *
 * A STYLE HAS A RECIPE, the four dial values it presses when chosen. It does
 * not name a side: light or dark is the reader's, and a style keeps it.
 *
 * A STYLE IS NOT LOST BY TWEAKING IT. Move a dial while Book is on and Book
 * stays on, marked "adjusted"; the tweak is remembered for Book, so coming
 * back to Book after a visit to Terminal finds it as you left it. Only a
 * tweak made by a reader's own press is remembered: a dial the site moves
 * for other reasons (a hidden room falling back to Neutral) is not a wish.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE CONTROLS RATHER THAN THE STORAGE. Each dial has its own
 * script with its own key, its own attribute and its own marks; a style
 * presses the rows the reader would press, so every control keeps its own
 * handler, its own storage and its own proof. The rows exist on every page,
 * because the rail's flyouts are in the document whether open or not.
 *
 * THE LIST IS THIS THEME'S, like the faces: which looks a site offers whole
 * is the site's decision. Palettes and sides are the system's registry
 * (quire.modes.js); the ids below are checked against it.

	   ÜBERSCHRIFTEN NAMES THE TITLE, NOT THE H1 (Manuel, 2026-09-17). It was 44,
	   the h1's size, so the article title — 64 at rest, the biggest thing on the
	   page and the thing a reader is looking at while dragging — came out 45%
	   over the number: 72 on the slider, 104 on the page. Nobody noticed while
	   the ladder ran 28 to 72 and every stop was near the title's own size; at
	   12 to 72 it is the first thing you see. No shipped style names a head
	   size, so nothing moves and there is nothing to migrate.

	   KOMMENTARE KEEPS 16, the size a comment reads at under the article, and
	   knowingly: with the frame on the comments stand in their own column at 13,
	   so there is no single number that is right in both places. Trading one
	   wrong number for another buys nothing. */

	/* THE MEMBERS OF A ROLE (Manuel, 2026-09-18; lab/the-members-of-a-role.html).
	   Oberfläche's one number names the menus and the buttons, the family's
	   lead, and four more sizes follow it in their order: the masthead above,
	   the card titles, the labels and the credit line below. That is how the
	   role always worked — one dial, five sizes in a hierarchy — and it is
	   what Manuel asked to keep by default ("one size, one role … unless we
	   could have another setting which binds some of them together and I
	   could unbind them on purpose").

	   So a member is BOUND unless the style says otherwise: it reads at its
	   resting size times the lead's factor, and the record does not mention
	   it. Released, it carries its own size, a rung of the interface ladder:
	   roles.ui.members.masthead = { size: '20' }. Absence is the binding, as
	   it is for the colour sides (`unlinked`). The stylesheet reads each
	   member through its own token with the lead's as the fallback
	   (--ui-size-masthead, var(--ui-size)), gated on data-ui-members so a
	   released member moves while the lead rests.

	   `rest` is the member's size at Standard's rest, read from the browser
	   (2026-09-18), which the panel multiplies by the lead's factor to say
	   the number a bound member reads at. The card titles rest at the base
	   size, the lead's own; they are a member because they are a different
	   set of things (the rail's rows, the related rows, the search results,
	   the newsletter door, the link card's name line, the ruler's label),
	   not because they were a different number.

	   `weight` is the member's resting weight, read from the browser the same
	   day (Manuel, 2026-09-18, on a bound row saying Bold over a semibold
	   heading: "fix the small lie"): a bound row says this until the role's
	   own weight dial moves, because that is what the element reads at. The
	   nearest named weight stands for the room's 420/440 body weight. */

	   size (ROLE_BASE) and the slider still opens there; it just no longer stops
	   early. The same argument as the weights on 2026-09-13 ("we always need the
	   full range").

	/* THE SAME TWENTY, THREE TIMES (Manuel, 2026-09-16: "the asymmetry is weird
	   and we should solve that. The customisation could also be like a list for
	   ink and for paper … a list for paper, a list for ink, a list for accent.
	   Underneath all three we have the colour wheel").

	   One set of hues runs through all three lists, each at the lightness its
	   job asks for: a paper is the palest step of its hue, an ink the darkest,
	   an accent the one that carries. Per side they turn over, because a dark
	   room's paper is the darkest step and its ink the palest. So Blau means
	   the same colour in all three lists and in both sides; what changes is
	   how much of it there is.

	   THESE ARE NOT THE PRESETS' COLOURS (Manuel, 2026-09-16: "the
	   customisation area is completely not connected to our presets … even if
	   it's the same colour they are not connected any more. It's more like, by
	   accident, the same colour"). A preset is a made pair and it is chosen
	   whole; these are parts, and choosing one is leaving the preset. A row
	   here is marked only when the reader set it here.

	   NOTHING IS BLOCKED. An unreadable pair can be built out of these, and
	   that is the reader's to build; the contrast chip on the ink says what
	   the pair reads at (Manuel: "that's their choice and that's the whole

	   created have quite dark grid lines compared to the paper, while Neutral
	   and Warmes Papier have much smaller contrast. I'm wondering how you
	   achieved that and why you chose that").

	   Because the recipe was a guess. The rail's ground was the paper carried a
	   PERCENTAGE OF THE WAY TO THE INK — 7% by day — and on the night side 40%
	   of the way to black, which is three times what any room does. A share of
	   the ink is the wrong measure: it makes the step as dark as the ink is, so
	   a preset with a deep ink got a deep rail, and the five rooms never did.

	   Measured, all ten sides of the five rooms move their surfaces by an
	   ABSOLUTE amount of lightness, in oklab, and by nearly the same amount
	   whichever side they are on (tools/check-steps.py prints the table):

	       canvas      -5      the rail's ground and the page behind the paper
	       plane       -2.5    the plane the paper lies on
	       navigation  -3.5 by day, -8 by night
	       subtle      -4.5    fields
	       raised       0 by day, +3 by night — a card is its paper by day

	   So the surfaces are stepped by lightness now, the hue and the chroma of
	   the paper kept, and a paper that is already black is left alone, which is
	   what Terminal does: its canvas IS its paper.

	   The second inks and the lines stayed fractions of paper-to-ink, which is
	   the right measure for them — a pale ink should give a pale second ink —
	   but they were measured too and moved: the rooms' secondary ink sits at
	   85% of the way to the ink where this wrote 75%, and their strongest line
	   at 29% where this wrote 26%. */
