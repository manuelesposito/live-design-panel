/**
 * Architrave — the reading face.
 *
 * Five faces, picked by the reader from the More menu, held in localStorage
 * and written to <html> as `data-face`. The stylesheet does the rest: one
 * token, --font-reading, is what every line of the article takes its family
 * from, and `:root[data-face="…"]` points it at the chosen face.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE READING SCALE'S, on purpose. Same storage-then-attribute
 * model, same menu grammar, same `.is-selected` plus check to say which is on,
 * same delegated click. A reader who has used one control has used the other.
 *
 * THE LIST IS THIS THEME'S, NOT A REGISTRY'S, and that is the honest place
 * for it: which faces a site reads in is the site's own decision. Chosen on
 * lab/the-reading-face.html (2026-09-05): Newsreader, Libre Baskerville,
 * Inter, Geist Mono, Pixelify Sans — every one of them variable. The pixel
 * choice is a TRIO since 2026-09-06 (Sixtyfour retired): Pixelify Sans for
 * the article and the interface (Handjet held the interface until 2026-09-07),
 * Workbench for code. A browser
 * fetches a face only when text is set in it, so the list is free until
 * someone picks from it.
 *
 * NEWSREADER NEEDS NO ATTRIBUTE. It is what `:root` says, so the resting
 * state is the absence of a choice, and a reader with no JavaScript reads
 * exactly what they always did. Every other choice is stamped before first
 * paint for the same reason the reading size is: a face that arrives late
 * reflows every line on the page.
 *
 * THE FIRST RELEASE (1.1.438) KNEW TWO IDS, `serif` and `sans`, and any
 * browser that saw it may still hold one. They resolve to their successors
 * rather than falling back to the default, so nobody's choice is lost.

	   each: Inter, Atkinson Hyperlegible, Geist; Newsreader, Libre Baskerville,
	   Vollkorn; Geist Mono, Martian Mono, Kode Mono; Geist Pixel, Workbench,
	   Pixelify Sans. The morning's list had a Display section — Tourney,
	   Bricolage Grotesque, Workbench — and the evening's names the section for
	   what is in it: the fourth is PIXEL, and all three of its faces are pixel
	   faces. Manrope, Bodoni Moda, EB Garamond, JetBrains Mono, Tourney and
	   Bricolage Grotesque left with it; Vollkorn and Kode Mono came back, and
	   Geist is here as a text face beside Geist Mono.

	   ALL VARIABLE BUT ONE. That was the rule ("all fonts should be variable
	   fonts, nothing else") and Geist Pixel cannot keep it: Vercel draws it as
	   five separate faces — Square, Grid, Circle, Triangle, Line — each one
	   weight, no axes at all. Square is the one shipped here, the plainest of
	   the five and the closest to a text face. It is not the first face without
	   a weight axis: Workbench has none either (its two are a bleed and a
	   scanline), so the weight row already knows how to disable itself, and the
	   same rule carries Geist Pixel.
