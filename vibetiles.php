/**
 * Plugin Name:       Vibetiles
 * Description:       Design your site on the live page: a panel with dials for colours, fonts, sizes and spacing, light and dark, and saved styles your readers can pick too.
 * Version:           0.53.0
 * Requires at least: 6.6
 * Requires PHP:      7.4
 * Author:            Elmastudio
 * Author URI:        https://elmastudio.de
 * License:           GPL-2.0-or-later
 * License URI:       https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Text Domain:       vibetiles
 *
 * The panel began inside the Architrave theme (2026-09-21) and this folder is
 * still ASSEMBLED by that theme's `tools/build-plugin.py`, so there is one
 * copy of every file and nothing can drift. On any block theme the plugin
 * stands alone: it brings the panel, its stylesheets, its fonts and its own
 * button, and the page keeps the theme's design until a dial moves. On an
 * Architrave that offers to host it (ARCHITRAVE_PANEL_HOST), the theme hands
 * the panel its rail and its square instead.
 *
